Typical options available for CU include clock selection, clock speed, caching and cache policy, protocol for external bus interfaces, general purpose I/O configuration (direction, active etc.) as well as dedicated options for peripherals and co-processors. A key aspect is also the definition of the configuration mechanisms that will be made available to the user including configuration protection features to prevent undesired/unauthorized changes. This is a collaborative efforts involving the same actors as Use Case 1, though driven by different criteria. The CU architect must balance the flexibility provided by configurability options with the added complexity it typically brings in terms of hardware design as well as verification effort. The product owner must balance programming complexity, potential higher cost and lower efficiency, with the capability of having their single CU instance capable of covering a broader problem space."@en;

The goal is eventually to define the product family i.e. to identify all the assets and their potential variations that can be used to provide a solution to any given problem within the target problem domain, rather than building for each problem an ad-hoc solution. The problem domain is specified by the customer/product owner, but can be typically expanded by the tech marketing team who captures requirements from other customers and push for alignment with strategic objectives. In defining the product line the CU architect is driven by objectives as costs, reuse, IPs while the product owner wants the product family to allow for a problem solution as close as possible to an ‚Äúoptimal‚Äù ad-hoc architecture."@en;

Simulation may include finite elements analysis, fluid analysis, DMU simulation, kinematics simulation, as well as simulation based on software prototypes. It also includes X-in-the-Loop (XiL), using integrated design and simulation models and capabilities.
Verification aims at the demonstration of product compliance to the specified design requirements.
Validation aims at the demonstration of conformance to stakeholder requirements.
