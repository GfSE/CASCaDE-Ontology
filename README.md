# CASCaDE Layered Ontology

The project is a joint initiative of GfSE e.V. and Prostep iViP e.V.. 
Goal is to submit a standard candidate at OMG - a Request for Proposals has been accepted in December 2024. 
Both organizations bring along the results of previously independent projects, namely the Specification Integration Facility (SpecIF) and the Digital Data Package (DDP).

The CASCaDE layered ontology aims at facilitating collaboration in the product lifecycle from conception to retirement. 

This is a proposal and we are happy about any critical feedback and proposal for improvement: 
We are looking for the most useful and versatile representation and every experience in this context is very valuable.

Are you interested? Have a look and let us know.
